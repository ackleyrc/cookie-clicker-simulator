Cookie Clicker is a web-based incremental (aka idle) game with the goal of producing as many cookies possible at time. To start, you simply click the mouse button to produce one new cookie per click. As you acquire more cookies, you may spend them on items that produce cookies automatically at increasingly faster rates. Each time you buy an item, the cost of that item increases by 15%. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_Clicker">Find out more about Cookie Clicker (Wikipedia)</a>

This project simulates a game of Cookie Clicker and demonstrates the effectiveness of different strategies. For example, one could simply buy the cheapest item as soon as it's available. However, since the cost increases over time, it becomes more effective to buy different items. An optimized strategy is to purchase the item that produces the most cookies per second per unit cost.
