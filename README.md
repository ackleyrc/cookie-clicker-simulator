Cookie Clicker is a casual web-based game with the goal of producing the most cookies possible. To start, you simply spam the mouse button to produce new cookies. As you acquire more cookies though, you may spend them on items that produce cookies for you automatically at increasingly faster rates. Each time you buy an item, the cost of that item increases by 15%.

This project simulates a game of Cookie Clicker and demonstrates the effectiveness of different strategies. For example, one could simply buy the cheapest item as soon as it's available. However, since the cost increases over time, it becomes more effective to buy different items. An optimized strategy is to purchase the item that produces the most cookies per second per unit cost.
